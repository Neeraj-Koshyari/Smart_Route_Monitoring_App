****Code Motive*****
Create an app using react native for road safety in this their will be google map in which their will be 2 windows automatic and manual.
In automatic the user will enter its destination location and the current location will be source location. so when the user will enter the destination then the most optimal path will be generated from the source to destination and  checkpoints will be generated in the path automatically and in those checkpoint a time will be given means when user start moving to the destination then the user should reach that checkpoint at that time if he does not reach that checkpoint at that time then an SOS pop up will displayed which will confirm whether the user is safe or not.

and in manual when the user enter destination location then the best route will be selected and then the user will click on the root  and checkpoint will be placed where the user click. after creation of checkpoint in those checkpoint a time will be given means when user start moving to the destination then the user should reach that checkpoint at that time if he does not reach that checkpoint at that time then an SOS pop up will displayed which will confirm whether the user is safe or not.

        />
    iOS-Specific Setup:
        If you're running this code on iOS, you need to install CocoaPods dependencies.
        cd ios
        pod install
        cd ..

3. Permissions Needed
    Android:
        Add the following permissions in android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:

Zoom Feature

    1. Focus on the Visible Center of the Screen:
        The getCamera method retrieves the current camera position and zoom level, ensuring any changes apply to the screen's center.

    2. Zoom Levels:
        The zoom property is adjusted by incrementing or decrementing it for zoom-in and zoom-out actions, respectively.
        
        Limits:
            -> Zoom-in max: 20 (very close to the ground).
            -> Zoom-out min: 2 (shows a wider area).
        
    3. Smooth Transitions:
        animateCamera creates a smooth zoom effect with the specified duration.


Errors while building:
1. Render Error (resolved)
    crypto.getRandomValues() not supported
    
    -> The error message comes due to the fact that crypto.getRandomValues() isn't natively supported in React Native. The GooglePlacesAutocomplete component internally uses the uuid package, which depends on crypto.getRandomValues().

    Solution: 
    -> To fix this, Explicitly add 'react-native-get-random-values' to your project and ensure it loads at the very beginning.
    1.  Install the Required Packages:
        -> npm install react-native-get-random-values
        -> npm install uuid

    2.  Import 'react-native-get-random-values' at the Top of Your Main File
        -> import 'react-native-get-random-values';

2. Current Location request get denied when moving from automatic to manual screen or vice-versa because of non     centrallized location request (Not-resolved)

3. Removal of all data when app cleared from background or move back to home screen (Not-resolved)

4. 'CMakeFiles/rules.ninja': No such file or directory
                 include CMakeFiles/rules.ninja
    
    Solution: 
    1. Clear Build Cache
            cd android
            ./gradlew clean

        Also delete the .cxx and build folders manually to fully clean native build artifacts:
        rm -rf app/.cxx app/build

    2. Rebuild the Project
        cd android
        ./gradlew assembleDebug

(Created on 23 APR 2025)
5.  Error: infinite pop-up for 'checkpoint miss' and 'sos call' 
    Error reason: calling the pip-up and sos call again and again because of regular check for
        next checkpoint expected Time.
    Solution: Stop the Simulation insted of continuation of simulation in background until "no"
    pressed on sosModule.


(Created on 27 APR 2025)
6.  Error: No Consideration of Checkpoint after stoping and again starting
    Error reason: creating new object insted of using previous object.
    Solution: Create the object only once.

7.  Error: Non Increment of Timer after stopSimulation button pressed and
        started Simulation again.
    Error reason: if paused and pressed stopSimulation button the isPaused state remain 'true'
    Solution: after pressing startSimulator button check for isPaused state if true make is 
        false.

8.  Error: TypeError: Cannot read property 'stopSimulation' of null
    Solution: Adding defensive checks before calling stopSimulation or other methods on
        simulator.


(Created on 29 APR 2025)
9.  Error: Updation of cordinates after pressing startSimulator in AutomaticScreen
    Error Cause: onReady callback in MapViewDirections component. This callback is being triggered every time the map re-renders (after moving from source to destination map re-render the updated current locaion).
    Solution: use of state variable which check whether already initialized checkpoints or not.

10. Error: Takes previous destination insted of new Destination
    Error Cause: no updation of simulator.
    Solution: reseted the simulator and created new simulator for different new destination


Fully Automatic SMS send feature (used Native Module work only for android)
(Created on 28 FEB 2025, Source: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-mobile-sms , https://reactnative.dev/docs/legacy/native-modules-intro)
    For sending fully automatic SMS we have to make 2 files and changes in MainApplication.kt file:
    File Location : android/app/src/main/java/com/routing

    1. SmsModule.java: (it holds the logic to send an SMS automatically from Android.)
        Purpose: This file contains the actual implementation of the functionality (sending an SMS).
        How It Works:
            -> It uses Android’s native SmsManager API to send an SMS.
            -> It exposes one or more methods (e.g., sendSMS) to JavaScript by using the @ReactMethod annotation.
            -> This module is a subclass of ReactContextBaseJavaModule and provides a name (e.g., "SmsModule") that JavaScript code can use to reference it via NativeModules.

    2. SmsPackage.java: (it wraps SmsModule so that React Native knows about it and can link it to JavaScript code.)
        Purpose: This file serves as a bridge between your custom native module and React Native’s module system.
        How It Works:
            -> It implements the ReactPackage interface.
            -> Inside its createNativeModules() method, it instantiates your SmsModule and adds it to a list of native modules.
            -> By registering this package (usually in your MainApplication.kt), React Native will include your custom module as part of the app’s available native modules.
